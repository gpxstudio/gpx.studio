# Help keep the website free (and ad-free) 🙏

Each time you add or move GPS points, we make a request to our servers to retrieve a route on the road network.
We also rely on APIs from <a href="https://mapbox.com" target="_blank">Mapbox</a> to load beautiful maps, retrieve elevation data and process geocoding requests (looking for a place in the search bar).
Unfortunately this is very costly so if you like the tool and use it frequently, please consider making even a small donation so that this website can stay **free** and **ad-free**.

Thank you very much for your support! ❤️
