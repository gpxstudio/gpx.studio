### Do I need to donate to use the website?

No, you don't need to donate to use the website or unlock any features.
The website is free to use and always will be (as long as it is financially sustainable).
However, donations are appreciated and help keep the website running.

### Why is this route chosen over that one? *Or* how can I add something to the map?

**gpx.studio** uses data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>, which is a crowd-sourced map of the world.
This means you can contribute to the map by adding or editing data on OpenStreetMap.

If you have never used OpenStreetMap before, you can:
1. Go to the location where you want to add or edit data on the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">map</a>.
2. Use the <button>Query features</button> tool on the right to inspect the existing data.
3. Right-click on the location and select <button>Add a note here</button>.
4. Explain what is incorrect or missing in the note and click <button>Add note</button> to submit it.

Someone more experienced with OpenStreetMap will then review your note and take the necessary action.

### Why is the elevation profile for my GPX file empty?

If the elevation profile for your GPX file is empty, it means that the GPX file does not contain elevation data.
You can add elevation data to your GPX file by using <a href="https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/elevation" target="_blank">GPS Visualizer</a>.
