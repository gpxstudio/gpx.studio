Unlike the file actions, the edit actions can potentially modify the content of the currently selected files.
Moreover, when the vertical layout of the files list is enabled (see [Files and statistics](../files-and-stats)), they can also be applied to [tracks, segments, and points of interest](../gpx).
Therefore, we will refer to the elements that can be modified by these actions as *file items*.
Note that except for the undo and redo actions, the edit actions are also accessible through the context menu (right-click) of the file items.

### <Undo2 size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /><Redo2 size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Undo and redo

Using these buttons, you can undo or redo the last actions you performed.
This applies to all actions of the interface but not to view options, application settings, or map navigation.

### <Info size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Info...

Open the information dialog of the currently selected file item, where you can see and edit its name and description.

### <PaintBucket size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Appearance...

Open the appearance dialog, where you can change the color, opacity, and width of the selected file items on the map.

### <EyeOff size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Hide/unhide

Toggle the visibility of the selected file items on the map.

### <FileStack size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Select all

Add all file items in the current hierarchy level to the selection.

### <ClipboardCopy size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Copy

Copy the selected file items to the clipboard.
