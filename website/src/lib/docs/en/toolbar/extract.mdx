title: Extract

<script>
    import { Ungroup } from 'lucide-svelte';
    import Extract from '$lib/components/toolbar/tools/Extract.svelte';

# <Ungroup size="24" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 5px" /> { title }

This tool allows you to extract [tracks (or segments)](../gpx) from files (or tracks) containing multiple of them.

<div class="flex flex-row justify-center">
    <Extract class="text-foreground p-3 border rounded-md shadow-lg" />
</div>

Applying the tool to a file containing multiple tracks will create a new file for each of the tracks it contains.
Similarly, applying the tool to a track containing multiple segments will create (in the same file) a new track for each of the segments it contains.

<DocsNote>
    When extracting the tracks from a file containing <a href="../gpx">points of interest</a>, the tool will automatically assign each point of interest to the track it is closest to.
