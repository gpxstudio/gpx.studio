To use this tool, you need to [select](../files-and-stats) multiple files, [tracks, or segments](../gpx).

- If your goal is to create a single continuous trace from your selection, use the **Connect the traces** option and validate.
- The second option can be used to create or manage files with multiple [tracks or segments](../gpx).
Merging files (or tracks) will result in a single file (or track) containing all tracks (or segments) from the selection.

<div class="flex flex-row justify-center">
    <Merge class="text-foreground p-3 border rounded-md shadow-lg" />
</div>
