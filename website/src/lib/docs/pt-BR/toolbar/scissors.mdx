## Cortar

Using the slider, you can define the part of the selected trace that you want to keep.
The start and end markers on the map and the [statistics and elevation profile](../files-and-stats) are updated in real time to reflect the selection.
Alternatively, you can drag a selection rectangle directly on the elevation profile.
Validate the selection when you are satisfied with the result.

<div class="flex flex-row justify-center">
    <Scissors class="text-foreground p-3 border rounded-md shadow-lg" />
</div>

## Dividir

To split the selected trace into two parts, hover over the trace on the map.
Scissors will appear at the cursor position, indicating that you can split the trace at this point.

You can choose to split the trace into two GPX files, or to keep the split parts in the same file as [tracks or segments](../gpx).
