Welcome to the official guide for **gpx.studio**!
This guide will walk you through all the components and tools of the interface, helping you become a proficient user of the application.

<DocsImage src="getting-started/interface" alt="The gpx.studio interface." />

As shown in the screenshot above, the interface is divided into four main sections organized around the map. 
Before we dive into the details of each section, let's have a quick overview of the interface.

## Menu

At the top of the interface, you will find the [main menu](./menu).
This is where you can access common actions such as opening, closing, and exporting files, undoing and redoing actions, and adjusting the application settings.

## Fitxers i estad√≠stiques

At the bottom of the interface, you will find the list of files currently open in the application.
You can click on a file to select it and display its statistics below the list.
In the [dedicated section](./files-and-stats), we will explain how to select multiple files and switch to a vertical layout for advanced file management.

## Toolbar

On the left side of the interface, you will find the [toolbar](./toolbar), which contains all the tools you can use to edit your files.

## Map controls

Finally, on the right side of the interface, you will find the [map controls](./map-controls).
These controls allow you to navigate the map, zoom in and out, and switch between different map styles.
