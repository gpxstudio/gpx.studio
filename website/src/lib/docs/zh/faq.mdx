### 我需要捐赠才能使用网站吗？

否
The website is free to use and always will be (as long as it is financially sustainable).
不过，我们感谢捐助并帮助保持网站的运行。

### Why is this route chosen over that one? _Or_ how can I add something to the map?

**gpx.studio** uses data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>, which is an open and collaborative world map.
This means you can contribute to the map by adding or editing data on OpenStreetMap.

If you have never contributed to OpenStreetMap before, here is how you can suggest changes:

1. Go to the location where you want to add or edit data on the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">map</a>.
2. Use the <button>Query features</button> tool on the right to inspect the existing data.
3. Right-click on the location and select <button>Add a note here</button>.
4. Explain what is incorrect or missing in the note and click <button>Add note</button> to submit it.

Someone more experienced with OpenStreetMap will then review your note and make the necessary changes.
