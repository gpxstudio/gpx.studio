### <Diff size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Map navigation

The controls at the top allow you to zoom in <Plus size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> and out <Minus size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" />, and to change the orientation of the map <Compass size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" />.

<DocsNote>

To control the orientation and tilt of the map, you can also drag the map while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.

</DocsNote>

### <Search size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Search bar

You can use the search bar to look for an address and navigate to it on the map.

### <LocateFixed size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Locate button

The locate button will center the map on your current location.

<DocsNote>

This only works if you have allowed your browser and <b>gpx.studio</b> to access your location.

</DocsNote>

### <PersonStanding size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Street view

This button can be used to enable street view mode on the map.
Depending on the street view source chosen in the [settings](./menu/settings), street view imagery can be accessed differently.

- <a href="https://www.mapillary.com/" target="_blank">Mapillary</a>: the street view coverage will appear as green lines on the map. When zoomed in enough, green dots will show the exact locations where street view imagery is available. Hovering over a green dot will show the street view image at that location.
- <a href="https://www.google.com/streetview/" target="_blank">Google Street View</a>: click on the map to open a new tab with the street view imagery at that location.

### <Layers3 size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Map layers

The map layers button allows you to switch between different basemaps, and toggle map overlays and categories of points of interest.

- **Basemaps** are background maps that present the main geographic features of the world.
  Depending on their purpose, basemaps will have different styles and levels of detail.
  Only one basemap can be displayed at a time.
- **Overlays** are additional layers that can be displayed on top of the basemap to provide complementary information.
- **Points of interest** can be added to the map to show different categories of places, such as shops, restaurants, or accommodations.

<div class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <DocsLayers />
    <span class="text-sm text-center mt-2">
        Hover over the map to show the <a href="https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org" target="_blank">Waymarked Trails hiking</a> overlay on top of the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/maps/outdoors" target="_blank">Mapbox Outdoors</a> basemap.
    </span>
</div>

A large collection of global and local basemaps and overlays is available in **gpx.studio**, as well as a selection of point-of-interest categories.
They can be enabled in the [map layer settings dialog](./menu/settings).

In these settings, you can also manage the opacity of the overlays.

For advanced users, it is possible to add custom basemaps and overlays by providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service" target="_blank">WMTS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service" target="_blank">WMS</a>, or <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/style/" target="_blank">Mapbox style JSON</a> URLs.
