Mapbox is the company that provides some of the beautiful maps on this website.
They also develop the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js" target="_blank">map engine</a> which powers **gpx.studio**.

We are incredibly fortunate and grateful to be part of their <a href="https://mapbox.com/community" target="_blank">Community</a> program, which supports nonprofits, educational institutions, and positive impact organizations.
This partnership allows **gpx.studio** to benefit from Mapbox tools at discounted prices, greatly contributing to the financial viability of the project and enabling us to offer the best possible user experience.
