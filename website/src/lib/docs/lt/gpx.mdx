The <a href="https://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp" target="_blank">GPX file format</a> is an open standard for exchanging GPS data between applications and GPS devices.
It essentially consists of a series of GPS points encoding one or multiple GPS traces, and, optionally, some points of interest.

GPX files may also contain metadata, of which the **name** and **description** fields are the most useful for users.

### <Waypoints size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Tracks, segments, and GPS points

As mentioned above, a GPX file can contain multiple GPS traces.
These are organized in a hierarchical structure, with tracks at the top level.

- A **track** is made of a sequence of disconnected segments.
  Furthermore, it can contain metadata such as a **name**, a **description**, and **appearance properties**.
- A **segment** is a sequence of GPS points that form a continuous path.
- A **GPS point** is a location with a latitude, a longitude, and optionally a timestamp and an altitude.
  Some devices also store additional information such as heart rate, cadence, temperature, and power.

In most cases, GPX files contain a single track with a single segment.
However, the hierarchy described above allows for more advanced use cases, such as planning multi-day trips with several variants for each day.

### <MapPin size="16" class="inline-block" style="margin-bottom: 2px" /> Points of interest

**Svarbios vietos** (techniškai vadinamos _waypoints_) atvaizduoja svarbią vietą, kad būtų galima atvaizduoti GPS įrenginyje arba skaitmeniniame žemėlapyje.

In addition to its coordinates, a point of interest can have a **name** and a **description**.
