    import { MapPin } from 'lucide-svelte';

[Points of interest](../gpx) can be added to GPX files to mark locations of interest on the map and display them on your GPS device.

### Creating a point of interest

To create a point of interest, fill in the form shown below.
You can choose the location of the point of interest either by clicking on the map or by entering the coordinates manually.
Validate the form when you are done.

<div class="flex flex-row justify-center">
    <Waypoint class="text-foreground p-3 border rounded-md shadow-lg" />
</div>

### Editing a point of interest

The form above can also be used to edit an existing point of interest after selecting it on the map.
If you only need to move the point of interest, you can drag it to the desired location.
